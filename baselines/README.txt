In this folder, we find the notebooks used to run the baselines of our experiments. In addition, we attach some modified files needed to run certain models.

If you need an extra file to reproduce an experiment or cannot quickly generate the prediction file, please let us know to provide you all these files. We did not incorporate everything to avoid so many changes in the original repositories, but it is worth mentioning that it was not easy to replicate the experiments due to errors and lack of documentation.
