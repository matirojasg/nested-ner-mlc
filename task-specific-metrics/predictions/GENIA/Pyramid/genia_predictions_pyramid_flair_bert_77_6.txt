Employing the EBV - transformed human B cell line SKW6 . 4 , we demonstrate that platelet - activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10 ( - 9 ) to 10 ( - 6 ) M .

Finally we explored the possible role of 5 - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5 - lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet - activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase A2 .

3,4,protein|25,25,protein|

Human T and B lymphocytes demonstrate an early and transient hyperpolarization after ligand binding .



Inasmuch as the change in membrane potential is dependent on elevation of free cytosolic calcium , the hyperpolarization is presumably through opening of Ca ( 2 + ) - stimulated K + channels .

We have used charybdotoxin , a known inhibitor of Ca ( 2 + ) - dependent K + channels , to study the role of these channels in lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .

We demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand - induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in B and T cells in a dose - dependent fashion , without affecting changes in cytosolic Ca2 + .



However , blockade of the Ca ( 2 + ) - activated K + channel is not associated with changes in cell - cycle gene activation , IL - 2 production , IL - 2R expression or B and T cell mitogenesis .

11,11,protein|
11,11,protein|21,22,protein|24,24,protein|

These are prominent enzymes in the endocytic pathway through which soluble protein Ag enter APC , and resistant segments in Ag may , therefore , be expected to contain more T - cell determinants than susceptible segments .

From information available in the literature on the substrate specificity of the three enzymes , it is clear that a cysteine is not accepted in any of the S2 , S1 , S1 ' , and S2 ' subsites of cathepsin B and L , and not in the S1 and S1 ' subsites of cathepsin D .

Thus , TNF alpha - induced NF - kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal - mediating kinases such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein kinase A , or Ca ( 2 + ) - regulated kinases .

Furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF - kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC , by a mechanism that increases NF - kappa B / I kappa B dissociation without affecting the NF - kappa B translocation step .

The Thy - 1 gene promoter resembles a " housekeeping " promoter in that it is located within a methylation - free island , lacks a canonical TATA box , and displays heterogeneity in the 5 ' - end termini of the mRNA .

Using transgenic mice , we show that this promoter does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position - dependent manner .

It can only be activated in a tissue - specific manner by elements that lie downstream of the initiation site .

18,19,DNA|

We have analyzed the functional domains of the minimal Thy - 1 promoter and show that the dominant promoter elements consist of multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 , an inverted CCAAT box , and sequences proximal to the transcription start site .

Nuclear factor kappa B activates proenkephalin transcription in T lymphocytes .

Upon activation , T lymphocytes accumulate high levels of the neuropeptide enkephalin which correlate with high levels of proenkephalin mRNA in the cells .

3,4,cell_type|18,18,protein|18,19,RNA|

Here we investigated the transcriptional basis for these changes .



The proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence GGGGACGTCCCC , named B2 , which is similar to the kappa B sequence GGGGACTTTCC , the binding site of the transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B .

1,2,DNA|9,9,DNA|16,18,DNA|22,23,DNA|26,27,protein|26,35,protein|

Activation of T lymphocytes induces an NF - kappa B - like binding activity to the B2 site , concomitant with activation of the proenkephalin promoter .

Mutations at the B2 site abolish this transcriptional activation .
3,3,DNA|
3,4,DNA|

The purified homodimer ( two p50s ) of the DNA - binding subunit of NF - kappa B binds the B2 site of proenkephalin relatively better than does the heterotetramer ( two p65s plus two p50s ) form of the factor .

However , as NF - kappa B is ubiquitous and the transcriptional activation through the B2 site is T cell specific , yet another T - cell - specific factor which synergizes with NF - kappa B should be considered .

When U937 cells were infected with HIV - 1 , no induction of NF - KB factor was detected , whereas high level of progeny virions was produced , suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication .

TR alpha 1 and TR beta 2 each formed a single major TR : TREp complex which comigrated with the least retarded complex formed by GH3 NE , while TR beta 1 formed multiple complexes suggesting that it can bind to TREp as an oligomer .

Interestingly , coincubation of 35S - TR alpha 1 , GH3 NE , and unlabeled TREp resulted in not only the 35S - TR : TREp complex , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing 35S - TR alpha 1 and comigrating with those formed by GH3 extract alone .

Incubation of each of the TRs with NE from COS - 7 cells , which do not possess sufficient endogenous TRs to mediate T3 - responses , resulted in formation of a new , more greatly shifted complex .

Truncation of TR alpha 1 at amino acid 210 prevented additional complex formation in the presence of NE without affecting DNA binding , suggesting that the carboxyl - terminus of the TRs is essential for interaction with nuclear proteins .

Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .
6,8,protein|
6,8,protein|

Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) mRNA production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic U937 cells and in a chronically HIV infected U937 cell line ( U9 - IIIB ) .

0,3,protein|0,9,RNA|5,7,protein|19,21,cell_line|25,30,cell_line|32,34,cell_line|

TNF - alpha RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9 - IIIB cells .

0,2,protein|0,3,RNA|7,8,cell_line|18,21,cell_line|

Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5 - to 10 - fold increase in the steady - state level of TNF - alpha RNA in U9 - IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV - infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF - alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .

The effects of TNF - alpha on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and the beta interferon promoter .
3,5,protein|16,19,DNA|22,23,DNA|26,29,DNA|31,31,DNA|35,37,DNA|
3,5,protein|16,19,DNA|22,23,DNA|26,29,DNA|31,31,DNA|35,37,DNA|

In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF - alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type - and promoter context - specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF - kappa B - containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF - kappa B DNA - binding activity .
13,14,DNA|16,18,protein|41,44,protein|41,47,DNA|53,56,protein|
1,1,cell_line|3,6,cell_line|13,14,DNA|16,18,protein|41,44,protein|41,47,DNA|53,56,protein|

Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF - alpha , multimers of the PRDII NF - kappa B - binding domain were inducible by both agents .
3,5,DNA|14,16,protein|21,28,DNA|22,25,protein|
3,5,DNA|14,16,protein|21,21,protein|22,25,protein|22,28,protein|

TNF - alpha was able to increase expression of the HIV LTR in T cells , but in monocytic cells , TNF - alpha did not induce the HIV LTR above a constitutive level of activity .
0,2,protein|10,11,DNA|13,14,cell_type|18,19,cell_type|21,23,protein|28,29,DNA|
0,2,protein|10,11,DNA|13,14,cell_type|18,19,cell_type|21,23,protein|28,29,DNA|

This level of NF - kappa B - independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since TNF - alpha treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo HIV type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection and viral RNA production in U937 cells .
3,6,protein|19,21,protein|42,43,RNA|46,47,cell_line|
3,6,protein|19,21,protein|46,47,cell_line|

However , in Jurkat cells , TNF - alpha dramatically enhanced the spread of HIV - 1 through the cell population and increased viral RNA synthesis , indicating that in T cells HIV - 1 multiplication was stimulated by TNF - alpha treatment .

Functional analysis of cis - linked regulatory sequences in the HLA DRA promoter by transcription in vitro .
3,7,DNA|10,12,DNA|
3,7,DNA|10,12,DNA|

Two consensus sequences , called X and Y boxes , capable of binding nuclear proteins and regulating expression in B cells have been defined within the immediate upstream region of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II promoters .
13,14,protein|19,20,cell_type|30,38,DNA|
1,2,DNA|13,14,protein|19,20,cell_type|26,28,DNA|30,38,DNA|

Unlike other class II promoters , the HLA - DR alpha ( DRA ) promoter also contains one element identical to the " octamer " motif of immunoglobulin variable region promoters that is responsible for B cell - specific transcription .
2,4,DNA|7,14,DNA|22,25,DNA|27,30,DNA|
2,4,DNA|7,14,DNA|22,25,DNA|27,30,DNA|

This " octamer " in the context of DRA appears capable of binding both the ubiquitous ( OTF - 1 ) and lymphoid - specific ( OTF - 2 ) " octamer " binding proteins , but at least one other distinct " octamer " complex was found .
2,2,DNA|8,8,protein|15,15,protein|17,19,protein|22,34,protein|26,28,protein|42,45,protein|
8,8,protein|17,19,protein|22,34,protein|

In order to characterize the function of cis - acting elements , we have developed an in vitro system in which a DRA promoter construct is transcribed more efficiently in extracts from B cells than in extracts from class II - negative HeLa cells .
7,10,DNA|22,24,DNA|32,33,cell_type|38,43,cell_line|
7,10,DNA|22,23,DNA|22,24,DNA|32,33,cell_type|38,43,cell_line|

5 ' deletion constructs which lacked the Y box , but retained the " octamer " motif and TATA box were completely inactive , and internal deletion of the Y box reduced transcription by 95 % .
7,8,DNA|13,16,DNA|18,19,DNA|29,30,DNA|
0,3,DNA|7,8,DNA|13,16,DNA|18,19,DNA|29,30,DNA|

Using supercoiled , but not linear templates , we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates lacking or disrupting the X consensus element that reflect effects of random replacement of X box sequences in transient expression assays .
20,22,DNA|30,32,DNA|
20,22,DNA|30,32,DNA|

Demonstration of the complete dependence on the Y box in this system suggests that , despite its demonstrated importance in the DRA promoter , the DRA " octamer " does not utilize OTF - 2 in a manner analogous to immunoglobulin promoters in B cells .

Lipopolysaccharide is a potent monocyte / macrophage - specific stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression .



Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - long terminal repeat ( HIV - 1 - LTR ) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte / macrophage - like cell lines but not a T cell line .

This effect appears to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) .
10,13,protein|15,18,protein|
10,13,protein|15,18,protein|

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from NF - kappa B in U937 and THP - 1 cells .
14,17,protein|19,19,cell_line|21,24,cell_line|
14,17,protein|19,19,cell_line|21,24,cell_line|

LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV - 1 production from a chronically infected monocyte / macrophage - like cloned cell line , U1 , which produces very low levels of HIV - 1 at baseline .
13,22,cell_line|24,24,cell_line|
13,22,cell_line|24,24,cell_line|

The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte / macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) before treatment with LPS .
17,23,protein|25,27,protein|
7,8,cell_line|17,23,protein|25,27,protein|

This stimulation of HIV - 1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of HIV - 1 RNA and and activation of NF - kappa B .
16,19,RNA|24,27,protein|
16,19,RNA|24,27,protein|

LPS is not able to induce HIV - 1 production in a cloned T cell line .

The effect of LPS on HIV - 1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV - 1 infection .



Steroid dose sparing : pharmacodynamic responses to single versus divided doses of methylprednisolone in man .



Inhibitory drug interactions affecting the metabolism of methylprednisolone ( MP ) may produce either steroid sparing or adverse effects partly by increasing the exposure time to the steroid .



This phenomenon can be mimicked by administering MP in divided doses .



Two types of responses were compared after a single MP dose ( 40 mg bolus ) and a divided regimen ( 20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later ) in six healthy male volunteers .



The suppression of basophils measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours .
3,3,cell_type|
3,3,cell_type|

The 37 . 5 % reduction in dose produced a 23 % overall decreased blood histamine response .



A pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of MP after both regimens .



A slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of basophil cell return to blood .
18,19,cell_type|


The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP of about 5 ng / ml were similar for both regimens .



The decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between MP treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours .



The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng / ml .



Pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the " dose - sparing " effects that were achieved by prolonging MP plasma concentrations .



This study supports previous clinical observations that patients may require morning through evening exposure to MP to optimize efficacy while adrenal suppression is being minimized .

To compare extra - renal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production in different types of granulomatous disease , and to identify the cell types responsible , we have evaluated the conversion of 25 ( OH ) D3 in 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 by uncultured cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and blood mononuclear cells from normocalcemic patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis .

1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was produced both by lavage cells ( 12 / 12 tuberculosis patients , 2 / 6 sarcoidosis patients ) and blood mononuclear cells ( 3 / 5 tuberculosis patients , 0 / 3 sarcoidosis patients ) from patients but not controls , but significantly greater amounts were produced by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients than those of sarcoidosis patients ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
11,12,cell_type|27,29,cell_type|
11,12,cell_type|27,29,cell_type|56,57,cell_type|

1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients correlated with the number of CD8 + T lymphocytes present but not other cell types .
9,10,cell_type|21,22,cell_type|
9,10,cell_type|19,22,cell_type|

T lymphocytes appeared to be an important source of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production , since purified T lymphocytes from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated lavage cells .
0,1,cell_type|20,21,cell_type|55,56,cell_type|
0,1,cell_type|19,21,cell_type|54,56,cell_type|

Because 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria , our results support the conclusion that macrophage - lymphocyte interactions , mediated at least in part by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response .

A closely related ( if not identical ) protein is found in both a human megakaryocytic cell line and purified human megakaryocytes ; it binds to promoter regions of two megakaryocytic - specific genes .

5,7,DNA|20,25,cell_line|

We show that in the human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line Molt4 c - myc mRNA and protein expression is down - regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore A23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration .
5,10,cell_line|11,15,RNA|12,14,DNA|

A block to RNA elongation is largely responsible for decreased c - myc transcription .

10,12,DNA|

Although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .



The calcium ionophore - induced c - myc suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis .

Therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in c - myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .

Growth experiments demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) tamoxifen ( TAM ) , quercetin and rutin exerted a reversible dose - dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in the range of concentrations between 10 nM and 10 microM .



The relative binding affinity of quercetin , rutin , DES and TAM for type - II EBS correlated well with their potency as cell growth inhibitors .

It has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone .



The higher affinity sites bind CVZ with 20 - to 50 - fold greater affinity , consistent with CVZ ' s enhanced biological effects .



In mutant leukemic cells resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone , CVZ both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in CEM C7 cells .

Active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 24R , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ( dioxyvit ) was used at a daily dose of 100 micrograms in treatment of children affected with tubulointerstitial disease of kidney and with chronic glomerulonephritis under conditions of kidney insufficiency .



The drug exhibited distinct normalizing effect on patterns of calcium metabolism : increase of total and ionized Ca2 + and of 25 - OHD , decrease in concentration of parath hormone and osteocalcine in blood serum as well as on immunological parameters : restoration of decreased content of T - and 0 - lymphocytes .



Concentration of receptors of hormonal form of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was found to be minimal in lymphocytes under conditions of chronic kidney insufficiency , while their expression , after the dioxyvit action , was detected only in patients with glomerulonephritis .

Pseudohypoaldosteronism in eight families : different forms of inheritance are evidence for various genetic defects .



Pseudohypoaldosteronism is a rare hereditary disorder presenting in early infancy with renal salt loss leading to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia despite high levels of plasma aldosterone .



The patients are insensitive to mineralocorticoids ; however , sodium supplementation is able to correct electrolyte abnormalities .



Absent or greatly diminished type I aldosterone receptors in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes have been recently demonstrated and explain the lack of response to mineralocorticoids .

There was evidence for an autosomal recessive form of inheritance in four families , while the other four families appeared to have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission .



In three families the autosomal recessive form was characterized by normal receptor as well as hormone data in both parents , while in one family receptor levels in both parents were greatly reduced , but hormone levels were normal .

All baseline interview and testing data were obtained either just before patients were discharged from the hospital , or at their first outpatient visit , within two weeks of discharge .



A major interest of this project is the predictive value of perceived social support , as a potential " stress " buffer , related to NK activity .



In the main model reported here , we found that a significant amount of NK activity variance could be explained by five variables .



Higher NK activity could be predicted by the perception of high quality emotional support from a spouse or intimate other , perceived social support from the patient ' s physician , estrogen receptor - negative tumor status , having an excisional biopsy as surgical treatment , and actively seeking social support as a major coping strategy ( R2 = 0 . 33 , F ( 5 , 55 ) = 5 . 5 , p less than 0 . 0004 ) .

20,22,cell_type|

In the absence of aldosterone , the intracellular Na + , K + and Ca2 + concentrations and the cell volume decreased significantly , but remained constant when aldosterone ( 1 . 4 nmol / l ) was added to the incubation medium .



These effects of aldosterone were blocked by the aldosterone antagonist canrenone ( 140 nmol / l ) .



The sodium / proton exchanger of the cell membrane could be identified as the primary target of the aldosterone action , possibly non - genomically mediated through membrane receptors .
1,4,protein|27,28,protein|
1,4,protein|27,28,protein|

The clinical significance of this model was underlined by the demonstration of absent or a decreased number of mineralocorticoid receptors and the lack of electrolyte response to aldosterone in human mononuclear leukocytes of patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism and aldosteronism .

In a series of functional studies we found that modulation of the level of the mRNAs coding for both the c - myc oncogene and the growth factor known as granulocyte - monocyte colony stimulating activity by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 correlated with the 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptor status of these cells .

Characterization of defensin resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the phoP virulence regulon of Salmonella typhimurium .
2,2,protein|10,12,DNA|
10,12,DNA|

The defensin sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phoP / phoQ two - component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins NP - 1 and NP - 2 .

1,1,protein|11,18,protein|29,31,protein|

Strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair ( phoP [ transcriptional activator ] or phoQ [ membrane sensor kinase ] ) had increased sensitivities to defensin .
8,9,DNA|11,11,DNA|13,14,DNA|17,17,DNA|19,21,protein|28,28,protein|
8,9,protein|11,11,protein|13,14,protein|17,17,protein|19,21,protein|28,28,protein|

The predicted periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with cationic proteins and that could be responsible for resistance to defensin .

2,3,protein|6,6,protein|6,7,protein|11,12,protein|17,18,protein|27,27,protein|

Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ , we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the absence of PhoP to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product .
4,4,DNA|8,8,DNA|16,17,protein|22,22,protein|32,32,DNA|32,34,protein|
4,4,protein|8,8,DNA|16,16,protein|16,17,protein|22,22,protein|28,28,protein|32,34,protein|

We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing PhoQ without PhoP were still markedly sensitive to defensins .
20,20,protein|22,22,protein|28,28,protein|
20,20,protein|22,22,protein|

This implied that a pag ( phoP - activated gene ) product is responsible for defensin resistance .
4,4,DNA|4,11,protein|6,6,DNA|6,9,DNA|15,15,protein|
4,11,protein|

We also tested for the ability of defensins NP - 1 , NP - 5 , and HNP - 1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have no effect .

Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP - PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC , as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation ( phenotype PhoPc ) , had no effect on defensin resistance , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages .

The expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or its enhancer sequence and the translocation of the HIV enhancer - binding protein NF - kappa B were analyzed in two human T - cell clones stimulated through their T - cell receptor complex or by tumor necrosis factor or phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate .

Our finding that induction of NF - kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is not sufficient to induce HIV enhancer - dependent transcription in cloned T cells contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T - cell lines and indicates that normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation .

Abnormal renal tubular phosphate transport is considered to be the primary defect in X - linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) .



However , the resistance to vitamin D treatment in XLH cannot be explained by hypophosphatemia alone .



Since most of the actions of vitamin D are mediated by its receptors ( VDR ) , abnormalities of VDR have been postulated in XLH .

On the contrary , there was no significant difference between the phosphate - supplemented patients ( 58 . 3 + / - 2 . 7 ) and controls .



There was a significant positive correlation between VDR concentration and serum phosphate ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .

Mammalian cells express two distinct forms of transcription factor CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the CREB gene transcript .

All three proteins show the same sequence specificity and binding affinity .



It appears that the B cell - specific expression of Ig genes is mediated at least in part by cell type - specific Oct factors , and that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 factors .

9,10,cell_type|12,15,cell_type|

However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , the factor is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non - lymphoid cells : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated NF - muE3 , was detected in B cells but not in non - B cells .

From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell - type - specific transcription in B lymphocytes : ( a ) cell - specific factors such as Oct - 2A and Oct - 2B that are not expressed in most other cell types : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as NF - kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif .

This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non - B cells , perhaps due to a non - permissive chromatin structure of the Ig heavy chain locus .

A 52 - year - old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which appeared first during childhood , increased in frequency without goiter or exophthalmos .



Cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded .



The thyroid function was normal regarding T4 , free T4 and T3 , TBG , radioiodine uptake , TSH and T3 suppressibility ; however the TSH response to TRH was decreased .



The lymphocyte nuclear T3 receptor was found with an affinity close to that of normal volunteers ( Ka : 1 . 42 x 10 ( 10 ) M - 1 vs 1 . 95 + / - 0 . 35 x 10 ( 10 ) M - 1 ) and a binding capacity markedly increased ( 9 . 9 vs 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 4 fmol T3 / 100 micrograms DNA ) .

Pindolol was inefficient on the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug .



Under carbimazole , the plasma T4 markedly decreased ( 27 . 7 + / - 3 . 6 nmol / l ) but the patient remained euthyroid .



The clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the heart to thyroid hormones , associated with an increased number of T3 nuclear receptor sites in lymphocytes .

The kappa B - binding activity with the HIV enhancer is inhibited only if it is activated via the mitogen phytohemagglutinin whereas phorbol myristate acetate - mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug .

TCF - 1 alpha , originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the HIV - 1 promoter , was found to bind to the TCR alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T - cell development than the TCR alpha gene ( e . g . , p56lck and CD3 delta ) .

Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that TCF - 1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57 - to 53 - kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature T - cell lines ( Jurkat , CCRF - CEM ) and not in mature B cells ( JY , Namalwa ) or nonlymphoid ( HeLa ) cell lines .

A small 95 - bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the TCF - 1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a cAMP - response element ( the CRE or T alpha 1 motif ) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid - specific protein ( TCF - 2 alpha ) behaved as a potent T - cell - specific enhancer in vivo .

Tandem copies of this enhancer functioned synergistically in mature ( Jurkat ) T - cell lines as well as resting and activated immature ( CCRF - CEM ) T - cell lines .

The TCF - 1 alpha binding site was also required for TCR alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from Jurkat but not HeLa cells , confirming that TCF - 1 alpha is a T - cell - specific transcription factor .

The OTF interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5 ' - CTCAGGA - 3 ' , and it seems likely that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter .

The N element could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both B - cell and HeLa - cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the octamer element , it can promote high levels of transcription in B - cell extracts .

The N element bound a transcription factor , NTF , that is ubiquitous in cell - type distribution , and NTF was distinct from any of the previously described proteins that bind to similar sequences .

As shown by a methylation interference analysis and oligonucleotide competition experiments , purified NF - kappa B binds at positions - 82 to - 91 ( GGGAACTACC ) of the GM - CSF promoter sequence with an affinity similar to that with which it binds to the biologically functional kappa B motif in the beta interferon promoter ( GGGAAATTCC ) .

The reason that only certain individuals of particular major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) haplotypes can mount T - cell responses against a given antigen of pathogens is found in the fact that T - cell receptors are designed to recognize 18 - 20 residue - long peptide fragments sandwiched between two alpha - helices of class I or class II MHC molecules .

FKBP has been shown to catalyze the interconversion of the cis - and trans - rotamers of the peptidyl - prolyl amide bond of peptide substrates ; here we show that rapamycin , like FK506 , is a potent inhibitor of the rotamase activity of FKBP ( Ki = 0 . 2 nM ) .

Further results , in which beta - gal activity is correlated with NF - AT - binding activity , indicate that the concentration of NF - AT must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates .

The recently discovered macrolide FK506 has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations 100 - fold lower than cyclosporin A , a cyclic undecapeptide that is used to prevent rejection after transplantation of bone marrow and organs , such as kidney , heart , and liver .



After the recent discovery that the cyclosporin A - binding protein cyclophilin is identical to peptidylprolyl cis - trans isomerase , a cellular binding protein for FK506 was found to be distinct from cyclophilin but to have the same enzymatic activity .

The first 40 residues of the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to those of the reported amino - terminal sequence of bovine FKBP , indicating that the DNA sequence isolated represents the gene coding for FKBP .

4,8,DNA|13,17,DNA|

To determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( OCTA ) - nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid - specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy - chain ( IgH ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid - specific transcription factor , designated NF - microB , in the murine IgH enhancer .

3,4,DNA|11,17,DNA|27,34,DNA|44,45,DNA|50,54,protein|57,59,protein|63,65,DNA|

We demonstrate that the NF - microB - binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B - cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .

This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .

Moreover , combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .

Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70 - base - pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that lacks the binding site for OCTA abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .

Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often causes latent infection .



Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV - 1 replication and pathogenesis .



The transactivator ( IE - 2 ) gene of the human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) can enhance HIV - 2 as well as HIV - 1 gene expression in vitro .

While the HIV - 2 and HIV - 1 tat genes and T - cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action , the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV - 2 tat or T - cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components .

12,15,protein|24,25,protein|

Both HIV - 2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV - 2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation , with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation .

Risk factors for breast recurrence in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with ductal cancers treated by conservation therapy .



Risk factors for local failure were evaluated for 496 clinical Stage I - II patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas ( median follow - up , 71 months ) treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy .



Monofactorial analysis identified the following factors to be correlated with increased risk : moderate / marked mononuclear cell reaction ( MCR ) , high histologic grade ( G ) , extensive intraductal component ( EIC ) , tumor necrosis , macroscopic multiplicity , estrogen receptor negativity , anatomic tumor size , age younger than 40 years , and vascular invasion .
43,44,protein|


Only MCR , G , and EIC proved significant in Cox multivariate analysis .



These risk factors were highly age dependent , with EIC markedly more prevalent in women younger than 50 , MCR and G in women younger than 40 .



Separate Cox analysis for premenopausal patients showed that MCR / EIC determined risk independent of resection margins : tumors with MCR had a 28 % , and with EIC a 22 % probability of recurring locally by 5 years .



Premenopausal patients with neither risk factor had a very low failure rate ( 2 . 6 % at 5 years ) , regardless of age .



For postmenopausal patients risk of breast recurrence was determined both by adequacy of resection margins and grade , with a high local failure rate for patients having G3 tumors with positive or indeterminate margins ( 31 % at 5 years ) .



The authors conclude that the microscopic examination is the only useful tool for assessing the risk of local failure , which is quite low for the majority of patients treated with breast conservation .



High - risk patients can be recognized morphologically .



The age dependence of morphologic risk factors appears to explain the high local failure rate seen in patients younger than 40 .

Four different methods were used to identify the proteins .

Two abundant proteins of 75 and 80 kD were competed out by poly [ d ( I - C ) ] in all reactions .



The cAMP - response element CRE , TGACGTCA , present in the 21 base - pair sequence , appears to be essential for specific protein - TRE - DNA interactions because mutation of the two G ' s destroys this complex .

In view of the therapeutic efficiency of glucocorticoids in AD and findings of abnormal cAMP and cAMP - phosphodiesterase activity , the elevated GR concentrations in AD lend support to the hypothesis of a compensatory GR upregulation due to an insufficient action of endogenous cortisol or to altered cAMP - induced GR expression .

Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on Ca2 + mobilization .



However , cyclosporin A and FK506 did not inhibit Ca2 + mobilization dependent expression of c - fos mRNA indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by Ca2 + is sensitive to these drugs .

Furthermore , we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin A and FK506 on six different transcription factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel Ca2 + dependent step that regulates several transcription factors .

A decrease of intracellular sodium or potassium occurred during incubation without aldosterone ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .



The addition of 1 . 4 nM aldosterone did not prevent this loss of electrolytes as observed in normal persons .



Plasma renin activity and aldosterone were not correlated with the electrolyte response and were within the normal limits .

The independence of intracellular electrolytes from aldosterone despite a normal number of mineralocorticoid receptors may reflect an impairment of the mineralocorticoid effector mechanism in the HML of patients with essential hypertension .

We now demonstrate the following .



( i ) Acute transfection and expression of EBNA - 2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased LMP1 expression in P3HR - 1 - infected Burkitt ' s lymphoma cells and the P3HR - 1 or Daudi cell line .

Some patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( DEX ) , yet they do not have Cushingoid features .



To study whether this represents glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance , [ 3H ] - DEX - binding assays were used to measure , in vitro , the GC receptor affinity ( 1 / Kd ) and number ( Bmax ) in mononuclear leukocytes of 11 MDD patients and 15 control subjects .
28,29,protein|42,43,cell_type|
28,29,protein|42,43,cell_type|

No receptor abnormalities were detected in the MDD group ; thus any cellular defect leading to a lack of responsiveness to GC in the MDD patients , if present , probably lies beyond the initial receptor binding .



DEX ( 1 . 0 mg orally ) was administered to study in vivo GC receptor down - regulation .
13,15,protein|
14,15,protein|

Compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down - regulated Bmax after DEX .



By paired t - test , Bmax decreased significantly in the control group but not in the depressed group .



Receptor number on the control day did not correlate significantly with the degree of receptor down - regulation , severity of depression or cortisol concentrations across all the subjects .



These results do not lend support to previous reports suggesting that GC resistance in MDD results from a GC receptor - binding abnormality , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of GC - mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect ( s ) leading to GC resistance .

NF - kappa B elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice lacking both I kappa B alpha and the p50 subunit of NF - kappa B show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities .

The activation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases ( Jak ) and STAT ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) proteins has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several cytokines .

Moreover , the induction of both Jak 1 and 3 , and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth - promoting effects of IL - 7 , suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in IL - 7 - induced proliferation .

In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated with OKT3 / PMA , tepoxalin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation with an IC50 of 6 microM .

However , the concurrent addition of iron ( in the form of ferrous or ferric chloride and other iron salts ) reversed the inhibition of proliferation caused by tepoxalin .



Tepoxalin also inhibits the activation of NF kappa B , a transcription factor which acts on several cytokine genes .

These data suggest that the action of tepoxalin to inhibit proliferation in PBMC may be at least in part due to its ability to reduce the amount of available iron resulting in decreased activation of NF kappa B and subsequent inhibition of cytokine production .

Analysis of the expression of human I kappa B alpha protein in stable transfectants of mouse 70Z / 3 cells shows that , as for the endogenous murine protein , exogenous I kappa B alpha is degraded in response to inducers of NF - kappa B activity , such as phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide .

Our results show that deletion of the C terminus of the I kappa B alpha molecule up to amino acid 279 abolishes constitutive but not ligand - inducible phosphorylation and inhibits ligand - inducible degradation .

Further analysis reveals that the inducible phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha maps to two serines in the N terminus of the protein ( residues 32 and 36 ) and that the mutation of either residue is sufficient to abolish ligand - induced degradation , whereas both residues must be mutated to abolish inducible phosphorylation of the protein .

Microtubules mediate cellular 25 - hydroxyvitamin D3 trafficking and the genomic response to 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human monocytes .
0,0,protein|21,22,cell_type|
0,0,protein|20,22,cell_type|

The genomic actions of 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
24,26,protein|28,28,protein|
23,26,protein|28,28,protein|

Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol - VDR complex , the role of microtubules in the response to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 has not been studied in viable cells .
14,17,protein|16,16,protein|22,22,protein|39,40,cell_type|
14,17,protein|22,22,protein|39,40,cell_type|

Our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .
7,8,cell_type|
6,8,cell_type|

Monocytes convert 25 ( OH ) D3 to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and to 24 - hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .

0,0,cell_type|

Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24 - hydroxylase mRNA and activity , without affecting either total 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 uptake or maximal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 - VDR binding .
23,26,RNA|51,52,protein|
23,25,protein|23,26,RNA|

Thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 - dependent modulation of gene transcription .
3,3,protein|
3,3,protein|

Interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis , not by decreasing the Vmax of monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha - hydroxylase but through an increase in the Km for 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .
2,2,protein|6,6,cell_type|22,22,cell_type|22,27,protein|
22,27,protein|

We examined 25 ( OH ) D3 transport .



Microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25 ( OH ) D3 uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .



Thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25 ( OH ) D3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 synthesis .

2,2,protein|12,12,cell_type|

Although the interrelationship between the two messengers Ca2 + and cyclic AMP in platelet function is well documented , its mechanism of action still remains to be established .

13,13,cell_type|

We investigated here the question of the regulation of platelet Ca ( 2 + ) - ATPases by cyclic AMP through the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein using a pathological model .
9,16,protein|25,26,protein|
9,16,protein|25,25,protein|25,26,protein|

We first found experimental conditions where Ca ( 2 + ) - transport by platelet membrane vesicles appeared to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein .
26,27,protein|
26,26,protein|26,27,protein|

Then , we studied platelets of patients with congestive heart failure for their expression of the potential 97 kDa Ca ( 2 + ) - ATPase target of regulation through the Rap1 protein as well as the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein using the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase ( C . Sub . ) .
4,4,cell_type|17,26,protein|19,25,protein|31,32,protein|40,41,protein|44,45,protein|48,53,protein|55,58,protein|

In the first patients studied , we found no significant modification in the expression of the 97 kDa Ca ( 2 + ) - ATPase by Western blotting using the PL / IM 430 monoclonal antibody which specifically recognized this isoform .
16,24,protein|30,35,protein|

In contrast , the Rap1 protein was differentially phosphorylated when using 15 micrograms / ml of the C . Sub .

4,4,protein|4,5,protein|

These results allowed us to use these pathological platelets to study the relationship between the expression of Rap1 protein and the regulation of Ca2 + transport by selecting a patient with severe heart failure .
8,8,cell_type|17,18,protein|
7,8,cell_type|17,17,protein|17,18,protein|

We could show a decrease in the expression as well as in the phosphorylation of Rap1 protein and demonstrate a lower effect of C . Sub . on Ca2 + transport .
15,16,protein|23,26,protein|
15,15,protein|15,16,protein|

Finally , by studying a further series of patients , we could confirm that the decrease in Rap1 protein expression in heart failure , whatever its extent , was variable , and could strictly correlate the expression of Rap1 protein with the stimulatory effect of C . Sub . on Ca2 + transport .
17,18,protein|38,39,protein|45,48,protein|
17,17,protein|38,38,protein|38,39,protein|

Besides the evidence for regulation of the expression of the Rap1 protein in platelets from patients with heart failure , these findings constitute a new approach in favour of the regulation of platelet Ca2 + transport through the phosphorylation of the Rap1 protein .

Lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to DNA damage - induced apoptosis , a response which may serve as a form of ' altruistic suicide ' to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion .

The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes , but an as yet unknown , p53 - independent pathway ( s ) appears to mediate the same event in mitogen - activated mature T lymphocytes .

3,3,protein|14,14,cell_type|22,22,protein|36,41,cell_type|

Here we show DNA damage - induced apoptosis in these T lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) - 1 .
10,11,cell_type|16,21,protein|17,18,protein|22,26,protein|
10,11,cell_type|16,26,protein|

Thus two different anti - onco - genic transcription factors , p53 and IRF - 1 , are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes .

We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin - 1 beta converting enzyme ( ICE ) gene , a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced - 3 , is IRF - 1 - dependent .

3,4,cell_type|19,20,cell_type|24,24,protein|26,26,protein|

This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B , which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to drive the HIV - 1 promoter .

Therefore , HIV - 1 - induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription .



Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV - 1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation .

Recent evidence for a preferential coupling of JAK3 to interleukin - 2 receptor - gamma ( IL - 2R gamma ) and JAK1 to IL - 2R beta supports the concept of heterotrans - activation of JAK1 and JAK3 caused by IL - 2 - induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners .

The present study verified the ability of IL - 2 to cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 and JAK3 , but demonstrated that IL - 2 stimulated JAK3 to a significantly larger extent than JAK1 in human T lymphocytes and the YT cell line .
7,9,protein|17,17,protein|19,19,protein|24,26,protein|28,28,protein|35,35,protein|37,39,cell_type|42,44,cell_line|

This conclusion was based upon several independent criteria , including more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 , more marked enzymatic activation of JAK3 as well as higher abundance of JAK3 in activated IL - 2 receptor complexes .

15,15,protein|22,22,protein|29,29,protein|32,34,protein|32,36,protein|

Furthermore , when human IL - 2R beta was stably expressed in murine BA / F3 cells , robust IL - 2 - induced proliferation and JAK3 activation occurred without detectable involvement of either JAK1 , JAK2 or TYK2 .

We therefore propose that IL - 2 receptor signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of JAK1 and JAK3 following IL - 2 - induced heterodimerization of IL - 2R beta and IL - 2R gamma .

Nonetheless , a membrane - proximal region of human IL - 2R beta ( Asn240 - Leu335 ) was critical for JAK3 activation , and the amount of JAK3 present in activated IL - 2 receptor complexes increased with time , suggesting that stabilization of JAK3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both IL - 2R beta and IL - 2R gamma .

Moreover , STAT5 was found to be the predominant STAT transcription factor used by IL - 2 in human T cells , and specifically required a COOH - terminal region of IL - 2R beta ( Ser386 - Val525 ) , while STAT5 recruitment was not correlated to activation of IL - 2R gamma or JAK3 .

Although evidence indicates that dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) exerts direct physiological effects , its mechanism of action remains unknown .



DHEA binding sites were examined using a whole - cell binding assay in a human T lymphoid cell line , PEER , revealing that a single class of high - affinity binding sites for DHEA ( dissociation constant = 7 . 4 + / - 0 . 53 nmol / L , mean + / - SE , n = 4 ) was greatly increased when treated with DHEA , phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate , and the Ca2 + ionophore A23187 .

Bound [ 3H ] DHEA was displaced sensitively by DHEA and secondarily by dihydrotestosterone , but not effectively by other steroids , including DHEA sulfate .



These results not only indicate the existence of a DHEA receptor , but also suggest that T cells become susceptible to regulation by DHEA during the process of signal - induced activation .

DESIGN : Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide , three times per day for 12 months .



Barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women .



Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study .



Hirsutism , graded by the modified Ferriman - Gallwey score , and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4 - month intervals during treatment .



Gonadotropin - releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy .

Hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment ( Ferriman - Gallwey score after 1 year : 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 versus 14 . 1 + / - 0 . 9 ) .



A reduction of serum androgens was found , whereas no change was observed in either basal or GnRH - stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha - hydroxyprogesterone response to ACTH .



Cycles remained ovulatory .



Before treatment , the number of androgen receptors was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase .

This rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug .

The sequence of one of these elements , OSE2 , is identical to the DNA - binding site of the PEBP2 alpha / AML - 1 transcription factors , the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Runt protein .

Here we show , using nuclear extracts , recombinant protein , and a specific antiserum against AML - 1 proteins in DNA - binding assays , that one member of this family , AML - 1B , binds specifically to OSE2 and is immunologically related to OSF2 , the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to OSE2 .

9,11,protein|19,20,DNA|25,25,DNA|
9,11,protein|19,20,DNA|25,25,protein|

Lastly , the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract - DNA complexes compared with T - cell nuclear extract - DNA complexes , along with the inability of OSF2 to be upregulated by retinoic acid , unlike the other PEBP2 alpha factors , suggest that OSF2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors .

Thus , this study demonstrates that AML - 1B can increase gene expression of an osteoblast - specific gene through its binding to an osteoblast - specific cis - acting element and presents evidence that OSF2 is a member of the PEBP2 alpha / AML - 1 family of transcription factors .

The Janus family tyrosine kinase Jak3 is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with gamma c , so it was hypothesized that defects in Jak3 might cause an XSCID - like phenotype .

A girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of XSCID was therefore selected for analysis .



An Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) - transformed cell line derived from her lymphocytes had normal gamma c expression but lacked Jak3 protein and had greatly diminished Jak3 messenger RNA .

The lack of Jak3 expression correlated with impaired B cell signaling , as demonstrated by the inability of IL - 4 to activate Stat6 in the EBV - transformed cell line from the patient . These observations indicate that the functions of gamma c are dependent on Jak3 and that Jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling .

17,22,cell_line|

Here we have confirmed and extended such observations , showing that ( 1 ) this phenomenon is restricted to the variant A of HHV - 6 : in fact two isolates belonging to the HHV - 6 variant B ( BA92 and Z29 ) were neither able to infect any B cell line , independently of the EBV status , nor to induce the EBV genome expression .

The only exception is represented by the P3HR1 cells , in which , however , the infection by the variant B does not determine induction of EBV antigens ; ( 2 ) the presence of the EBV genome contributes to the susceptibility of the B cell lines to HHV - 6 infection , increasing the binding sites and the percentage of infectable cells , as detected by immunoelectron microscopy ; and ( 3 ) HHV - 6 infected T cells , transfected with plasmids bearing the promoter regions of the EBV early genes BZLF1 and BMRF1 , show a strong transactivation of these promoters .

Absorptive hypercalciuria ( a stone - forming condition ) is characterized by gut hyperabsorption of calcium , hypercalciuria , and reduced bone density .



Inasmuch as these features implicate enhanced calcitriol action in gut and bone , we analyzed the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene to ascertain whether an abnormality of this gene marks patients with intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium .

16,18,protein|16,22,DNA|

We have compared the frequency of a restriction fragment length polymorphism ( Bsm I ) associated with different alleles of the VDR gene in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race - and age - matched control subjects .

The coding region of VDR messenger RNA was also normal , as determined by both DNA sequence analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy DNA from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients .

On the basis of these results , we propose that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to mutations of the VDR and are not linked to a common VDR genotype .

Sequence analysis of the 5 ' - flanking region of the CD69 gene revealed the presence of a potential TATA element 30 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site and several putative binding sequences for inducible transcription factors ( NF - kappa B , Egr - 1 , AP - 1 ) , which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene .

Transient expression of CD69 promoter - based reporter gene constructs in K562 cells indicated that the proximal promoter region spanning positions - 78 to + 16 contained the cis - acting sequences necessary for basal and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate - inducible transcription of the CD69 gene .

Removal of the upstream sequences located between positions - 78 and - 38 resulted in decreased promoter strength and abolished the response to phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate .

We also found that tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) is capable of inducing the surface expression of the CD69 molecule as well as the promoter activity of fusion plasmids that contain 5 ' - flanking sequences of the CD69 gene , suggesting that this cytokine may regulate in vivo the expression of CD69 .

To determine if platelet thromboxane receptors are under transcriptional control , we isolated and characterized human genomic DNA clones containing the 5 ' flanking region of the thromboxane receptor gene .

3,5,protein|15,18,DNA|21,24,DNA|27,29,DNA|

The exon - intron structure of the 5 ' portion of the thromboxane receptor gene was determined initially by comparing the nucleotide sequence of the 5 ' flanking genomic clone with that of a novel human uterine thromboxane receptor cDNA that extended the mRNA 141 bp further upstream than the previously identified human placental cDNA .

Promoter function of the 5 ' flanking region of the thromboxane receptor gene was evaluated by transfection of thromboxane receptor gene promoter / chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) chimera plasmids into platelet - like K562 cells .

Functional analysis of 5 ' deletion constructs in transfected K562 cells and gel mobility shift localized the major phorbol ester - responsive motifs in the thromboxane receptor gene promoter to a cluster of activator protein - 2 ( AP - 2 ) binding consensus sites located approximately 1 . 8 kb 5 ' from the transcription initiation site .

These studies are the first to determine the structure and organization of the 5 ' end of the thromboxane receptor gene and demonstrate that thromboxane receptor gene expression can be regulated by activation of protein kinase C via induction of an AP - 2 - like nuclear factor binding to upstream promoter elements .

These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism for previously described upregulation of platelet thromboxane receptors after acute myocardial infarction is increased thromboxane receptor gene transcription in platelet - progenitor cells .

Estrogen receptor concentration and social factors as predictors of natural killer cell activity in early - stage breast cancer patients .

0,1,protein|9,11,cell_type|

Confirmation of a model .



Previous work of ours has demonstrated that a significant amount of natural killer ( NK ) activity variance after surgery in stage I and II breast cancer patients could be accounted for by both the estrogen receptor ( ER ) status of the tumor and by social factors , namely , perceived social support and seeking social support as a general coping strategy .
35,36,protein|38,38,protein|
35,36,protein|38,38,protein|

As considerable evidence has accumulated that social support in both animal and human populations may have survival value , we sought to test the reliability of this regression model , using coping and perceived support factor values obtained at 3 months after surgery to account for concurrent follow - up NK activity in this serially assessed group of patients .



It was found that the most significant variable predicting NK activity at follow - up was tumor ER concentration , with higher NK activity associated with ER - status .
17,17,protein|26,26,protein|
17,17,protein|

In addition , seeking social support as a coping strategy , as well as the perceived quality of support , also entered the model to account for a significant amount of NK activity variance ( multivariate F = 5 . 25 , p less than 0 . 001 ) .



If , as the literature suggests , NK activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since ER - tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by NK cells because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of effector cells to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action .
18,18,protein|38,39,cell_type|50,51,cell_type|
38,39,cell_type|50,51,cell_type|

The finding related to social support also replicates results from an independent sample of breast cancer patients .



This finding , taken together with other evidence that this social variable is associated with longer survival in breast cancer populations , underscores the potential importance of this social support variable .



Our findings also suggest one possible immunological variable involved , with potential clinical significance , for this patient population .

We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - dependent cell - free activation system of NF - kappa B in association with the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation .

In this study , we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the LPS - stimulated human monocytic cell line , THP - 1 , that specifically binds and phosphorylates I kappa B alpha .

5,8,protein|14,17,cell_line|

Mutational analyses of I kappa B alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C - terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha .

3,6,protein|29,33,protein|35,38,protein|

Moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the C - terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha , blocked the LPS - induced NF - kappa B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous I kappa B alpha in a cell - free system using THP - 1 cells .

11,15,protein|17,20,protein|27,30,protein|39,42,protein|50,53,cell_line|

These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C - terminal region of I kappa B alpha and subsequent dissociation of the NF - kappa B . I kappa B alpha complex .

We have identified a novel cellular protein , Bik , that interacts with the cellular survival - promoting proteins , Bcl - 2 and Bcl - xL , as well as the viral survival - promoting proteins , Epstein Barr virus - BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B - 19 kDa .

In transient transfection assays , Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death - promoting members of the Bcl - 2 family , Bax and Bak .

5,5,protein|15,18,protein|21,24,protein|26,26,protein|28,28,protein|

This death - promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl - 2 , Bcl - XL , EBV - BHRF1 and E1B - 19 kDa proteins suggesting that Bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti - apoptotic proteins .

While Bik does not show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl - 2 family , it does share a 9 amino acid domain ( BH3 ) with Bax and Bak which may be a critical determinant for the death - promoting activity of these proteins .

In contrast , expression reportedly occurs in multiple nonlymphoid tissues during murine embryogenesis .



We have now raised a monoclonal antibody to document expression and biochemistry of the human TCF - 1 protein .
5,6,protein|14,18,protein|15,17,protein|

4,6,protein|4,7,protein|12,13,cell_line|15,16,cell_type|

Its expression was always restricted to the nucleus .



Immunohistochemistry on a panel of human tissues revealed that the TCF - 1 protein was found exclusively in thymocytes and in CD3 + T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues .
10,12,protein|10,13,protein|21,24,cell_line|23,24,cell_type|
10,12,protein|10,13,protein|18,18,cell_type|21,24,cell_type|

Western blotting yielded a set of bands ranging from 25 kD to 55 kD , resulting from extensive alternative splicing .



The TCF - 1 protein was detectable in all samples of a set of 22 T - cell malignancies of various stages of maturation , but was absent from a large number of other hematologic neoplasms .
1,3,protein|15,18,cell_type|34,35,cell_type|

These observations imply a T cell - specific function for TCF - 1 , a notion corroborated by recent observations on Tcf - 1 knock - out mice .

Here we report that cross - linking of Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII by adherent human IgG or by specific anti - Fc gamma R mAb activates HIV - 1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line BF24 and increased HIV RNA expression in monocytes from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription - PCR .

In THP - 1 cells , Fc gamma R cross - linking induced NF - kappa B , which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV - 1 and to activate HIV - 1 transcription . Anti - TNF - alpha antibody but not anti - IL - 1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV - 1 - LTR - driven transcription and the induction of NF - kappa B by Fc gamma R cross - linking .

These results indicate that Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF - alpha - dependent induction of HIV - 1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV - 1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes .

To compare the role of CD28 , neonatal and adult T cells were stimulated with a pair of mitogenic anti - CD2 antibodies in the presence or absence of anti - CD28 MoAb .

With anti - CD2 alone , neonatal T cells proliferated slightly but produced no detectable IL - 2 , whereas adult T cells proliferated vigorously , with significant IL - 2 production .

1,3,protein|6,8,cell_type|15,17,protein|20,22,cell_type|28,30,protein|

Costimulation with anti - CD28 MoAb greatly enhanced the proliferative response of neonatal T cells to levels equivalent to those of adult T cells , whereas adult T cells showed only slight increases .

2,5,protein|12,14,cell_type|21,23,cell_type|26,28,cell_type|

Although IL - 2 secretion was increased in the presence of anti - CD28 MoAb , neonatal T cell IL - 2 production remained lower than in adults .

2,2,protein|2,3,protein|6,8,protein|
0,3,protein|6,8,protein|

The cellular mechanism governing the diminished proliferative response of neonatal T lymphocytes to anti - CD2 may therefore be due to decreased NF kappa B induction , reduced IL - 2 mRNA expression and deficient IL - 2 production .

The TCL1 oncogene on human chromosome 14q32 . 1 is involved in chromosome translocations [ t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 . 1 ) and t ( 7 ; 14 ) ( q35 ; q32 . 1 ) ] and inversions [ inv14 ( q11 ; q32 . 1 ) ] with TCR alpha / beta loci in T - cell leukemias , such as T - prolymphocytic ( T - PLL ) .

It is also involved in T - acute and - chronic leukemias arising in cases of ataxia - telangiectasia ( AT ) , an immunodeficiency syndrome .



Similar chromosomal rearrangements occur also in the clonally expanded T cells in AT patients before the appearance of the overt leukemia .

We have analyzed the expression of TCL1 mRNA and protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) from four AT cases and from healthy controls .

6,6,protein|6,7,RNA|11,13,cell_type|15,15,cell_type|

We found that the TCL1 gene was overexpressed in the PBLs of an AT patient with a large clonal T - cell population exhibiting the t ( 14 ; 14 ) translocation but not in the lymphocytes of the other cases .
4,5,DNA|10,10,cell_type|17,22,cell_line|36,36,cell_type|
4,5,DNA|10,10,cell_type|36,36,cell_type|

Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the TCL1 genomic locus to lymphocyte metaphases from the AT patient with the T - cell clonal expansion showed that the breakpoint of the t ( 14 ; 14 ) translocation lies within the TCL1 locus and is accompanied by an inverted duplication of the distal part of chromosome 14 .

6,6,DNA|6,8,DNA|29,35,DNA|39,39,DNA|39,40,DNA|53,54,DNA|

These data indicate that TCL1 is activated in preleukemic clonal cells as a consequence of chromosome translocation involving sequences from the TCR locus at 14q11 .

Inhibition of endogenous C / EBP proteins , using either an excess of C / EBP binding sites or a trans - dominant negative inhibitor , demonstrated that C / EBP proteins are required for basal and activated levels of HIV - 1 LTR transcription in the promonocytic cell line U937 .

Northern ( RNA ) blots and binding assays showed that NF - IL6 is the only known C / EBP family member which is increased when U937 cells are activated .
10,12,protein|17,21,protein|26,27,cell_line|
10,12,protein|17,21,protein|26,27,cell_line|

Mutational analyses of the HIV - 1 LTR showed that one C / EBP site is required for normal LTR transcription both before and after cellular activation and that the two 3 ' C / EBP sites are functionally equivalent .

4,7,DNA|11,14,DNA|19,19,DNA|31,36,DNA|

The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) may include a spectrum of retroviruses with varying potential to infect their host , undergo long periods of latent infection , and induce pathology .



Since expression of the viruses is in large part regulated by the sequence elements in their long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) , this study was directed to an analysis of the regulatory elements in the HIV - 2 LTR .
12,13,DNA|16,18,DNA|20,20,DNA|32,33,DNA|36,39,DNA|
12,13,DNA|16,18,DNA|20,20,DNA|32,33,DNA|36,39,DNA|

The HIV - 2 LTR was found to contain two enhancers .

One of these enhancers is , in part , identical to the HIV - 1 enhancer .
3,3,DNA|12,15,DNA|
3,3,DNA|12,15,DNA|

This enhancer in HIV - 1 is the T - cell activation response element ; in HIV - 2 , however , it is the second enhancer that is mainly responsible for activation in response to T - cell activators .
1,1,DNA|8,13,DNA|25,26,DNA|
1,1,DNA|8,13,DNA|26,26,DNA|36,39,protein|

The second enhancer interacts with two nuclear binding proteins ( 85 kD and 27 kD mobility ) that appear to be required for optimal enhancer function and activation .

2,2,DNA|6,8,protein|

Observations such as these encourage the speculation that there may be subtle differences in the regulation of HIV - 1 and HIV - 2 expression that may be relevant to the possible longer latency and reduced pathogenicity of HIV - 2 .

Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) was originally described as a T - cell - specific transcription factor athat supported the activation of cytokine gene expression and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .

As we observed that activated endothelial cells also expressed NFAT , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in endothelial cells .
4,6,cell_type|9,9,protein|19,20,cell_type|
4,6,cell_type|9,9,protein|19,20,cell_type|

Significantly , CsA completely suppressed the induction of NFAT in endothelial cells and inhibited the activity of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) gene regulatory elements that use NFAT by 60 % .
8,8,protein|10,11,cell_type|17,23,protein|17,31,DNA|25,27,protein|34,34,protein|
8,8,protein|10,11,cell_type|17,23,protein|17,31,DNA|25,27,protein|34,34,protein|

CsA similarly mediated a reduction of up to 65 % in GM - CSF mRNA and protein expression in activated endothelial cells .
11,13,protein|11,14,RNA|19,21,cell_type|
11,13,protein|11,14,RNA|19,21,cell_type|

CsA also suppressed E - selectin , but not vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) expression in endothelial cells , even though the E - selectin promoter is activated by NF - kappa B rather than NFAT .

Hence , induction of cell surface expression of this leukocyte adhesion molecule by tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha was reduced by 40 % in the presence of CsA , and this was reflected by a 29 % decrease in neutrophil adhesion .
9,11,protein|13,20,protein|42,42,cell_type|
9,11,protein|13,20,protein|42,42,cell_type|

Protein phosphorylation has an important role in the regulation of these two factors : ( 1 ) it induces the transactivating capacity of the AP - 1 protein c - Jun ; and ( 2 ) it is involved in the release of the cytoplasmic inhibitor , I kappa B , from NF - kappa B , allowing translocation of the latter into the nucleus .

Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .



The earliest lesion in the development of an atherosclerotic plaque is the fatty streak .



This chronic inflammatory reaction results from a sequence of events that begins with the trapping of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) in the subendothelial space of the artery wall .

16,18,protein|20,20,protein|

The trapped LDL is seeded with oxidative species released by the overlying endothelium , and lipid oxidation is initiated within the LDL particle . Some of the lipids that result lead to the activation of NFkB - like transcription factors that cause the expression of genes whose protein products mediate monocyte binding , monocyte chemotaxis into the subendothelial space , and conversion into macrophages .

Activation of individual CD4 + T cells results in differential lymphokine expression : interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) is preferentially produced by T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) cells , which are involved in cell - mediated immune responses , whereas IL - 4 is synthesized by TH2 cells , which are essential for humoral immunity .

3,3,protein|16,18,protein|29,29,protein|44,46,protein|49,51,cell_line|

This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of NF - ATp and NF - kappa B to the P sequence , an element located 69 bp upstream of the IL4 transcription initiation site .

In contrast , protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does not affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence , which is a higher - affinity site for NF - ATp and a lower - affinity site for RelA .

The observation that binding sites for the nuclear factor - mu negative regulator ( NF - muNR ) enhancer repressor overlap nuclear matrix attachment regions ( MARs ) in this enhancer has lead to the hypothesis that the cell type specificity of the enhancer might be controlled by regulating nuclear matrix attachment ( Scheuermann , R .

While in vitro administration of glucocorticoids may inhibit concanavalin A ( Con A ) - and phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) - induced T - cell proliferation , pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) - driven B - cell mitogenesis is relatively resistant to glucocorticoids .

To further explore the link between the HPA and the immune system in relation to glucocorticoid receptor function , dose - response curves were obtained for Con A - and PHA - induced T - cell mitogenesis , PWM - generated B - cell mitogenesis and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in 13 healthy controls .

Glucocorticoid effects were assessed in vivo by depletion of endogenous glucocorticoids after oral administration of 1 . 5 g metyrapone ( MET ) and subsequent glucocorticoid replacement , and in vitro by incubation of the cells with different doses of dexamethasone ( DEX ) .



There was a significant decrease in PWM - induced B - cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of DEX administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after MET treatment when compared with the DEX plus MET pretreated condition in vivo .

The reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) in humans are unknown but may relate to differences in the capacities of the E1A and E7 proteins to target cells for rejection by the host natural killer ( NK ) cell response .

Oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , may represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies .



Oxidative stress enhances nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) activity , and NF - kappa B activity has been shown to enhance the expression of cytotoxic cytokines .

Acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 in mice .



This injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water - soluble emulsion of alpha - tocopherol .



Alpha - tocopherol treatment of the mice given the CCl4 also reduced the NF - kappa B binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice .

In the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .

This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time - frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .



It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .



Taking the IL - 2 gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors AP - 1 , NF - kappa B , NF - AT and Oct1 , whose functions are required for expression of the IL - 2 mRNA .

6,9,protein|14,16,protein|23,24,protein|

The induction of STAT activity was inhibited completely by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or cyclosporin A , thus indicating that the induction was due to a secondary factor produced by the activated T cells .

As neutralizing anti - IL - 6 Abs effectively down - regulated the early induction of STAT proteins and as exogenously added IL - 6 rapidly activated DNA binding similar to TCR - mediated bindings , it can be concluded that IL - 6 is the factor responsible for the activation of STAT proteins in a primary T cell response .

Because these genes play a positive role in cell proliferation , we suggest that this regulatory switch contributes to controlling entry into the cell cycle .



Transient stimulation of quiescent B lymphocytes with either a cocktail of anti - CD40 , anti - IgM , and IL4 , or EBV results in the rapid expression of the same four genes , suggesting that , after infection , EBV exploits the normal program of B - lymphocyte cell cycle activation .

In this paper we demonstrate that the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) enhancer , which contains DNA - binding sites for LEF - 1 and Ets - 1 , also provides a functional context for activation by LEF - 1 .

A truncation mutant of LEF - 1 ( HMG - 88 ) , which contains the HMG box but lacks the trans - activation domain , did not activate transcription from nucleosomal DNA , indicating that bending of DNA by the HMG domain is not sufficient to activate transcription in vitro .
