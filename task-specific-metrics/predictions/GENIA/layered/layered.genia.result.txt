Previous work of ours has demonstrated that a significant amount of natural killer ( NK ) activity variance after surgery in stage I and II breast cancer patients could be accounted for by both the estrogen receptor ( ER ) status of the tumor and by social factors , namely , perceived social support and seeking social support as a general coping strategy .

As considerable evidence has accumulated that social support in both animal and human populations may have survival value , we sought to test the reliability of this regression model , using coping and perceived support factor values obtained at 0 months after surgery to account for concurrent follow - up NK activity in this serially assessed group of patients .

If , as the literature suggests , NK activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since ER - tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by NK cells because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of effector cells to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action .

First , we show that mutations in the LEF - 0 - binding site inhibit the activity of multimerized copies of the HIV - 0 enhancer in Jurkat T cells , and that LEF - 0 / GAL0 can activate a GAL0 - substituted HIV - 0 enhancer 00 - to 000 - fold in vivo .

By using a nucleosome - assembly system derived from Drosophila embryos , we find that the packaging of DNA into chromatin in vitro strongly represses HIV - 0 transcription and that repression can be counteracted efficiently by preincubation of the DNA with LEF - 0 ( or LEF - 0 and Ets - 0 ) supplemented with fractions containing the promoter - binding protein , Sp0 .

Addition of TFE - 0 , which binds to an E - box motif upstream of the LEF - 0 and Ets - 0 sites , further augments transcription in this system .

Individually or collectively , none of the three enhancer - binding proteins ( LEF - 0 , Ets - 0 , and TFE - 0 ) could activate transcription in the absence of Sp0 .

A truncation mutant of LEF - 0 ( HMG - 00 ) , which contains the HMG box but lacks the trans - activation domain , did not activate transcription from nucleosomal DNA , indicating that bending of DNA by the HMG domain is not sufficient to activate transcription in vitro .

We conclude that transcription activation by LEF - 0 in vitro is a chromatin - dependent process that requires a functional trans - activation domain in addition to the HMG domain .
